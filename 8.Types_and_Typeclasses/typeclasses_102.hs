--typclasses are like interfaces. 
--A typeclass defines some behavior 
--and then types that can behave in that way are made instances of that typeclass.

--Eq typeclass is for stuff that can be equated.

class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -> a-> Bool
    (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    x == y = not (x /= y)
    x /= y = not (x == y)

--Some people might understand this better if 
--we wrote class Eq equatable where and then specified the type declarations like (==) :: equatable -> equatable -> Bool.

data TrafficLight = Red | Yellow | Green  

--Notice how we didn't derive any class instances for it.
--That's because we're going to write up some instances by hand, even though we could derive them for types like Eq and Show. 

instance Eq TrafficLight where  
    Red == Red = True  
    Green == Green = True  
    Yellow == Yellow = True  
    _ == _ = False  

--Because == was defined in terms of /= and vice versa in the class declaration, 
--we only had to overwrite one of them in the instance declaration. 
--That's called the minimal complete definition for the typeclass â€” 
--the minimum of functions that we have to implement so that our type can behave like the class advertises.
--To fulfill the minimal complete definition for Eq, we have to overwrite either one of == or /=. 

--If Eq was defined simply like this:

--class Eq a where  
--    (==) :: a -> a -> Bool  
--    (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool  
--we'd have to implement both of these functions when making a type an instance of it, 
--because Haskell wouldn't know how these two functions are related. 
--The minimal complete definition would then be: both == and /=.

instance Show TrafficLight where  
    show Red = "Red light"  
    show Yellow = "Yellow light"  
    show Green = "Green light"
