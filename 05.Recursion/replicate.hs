--takes in an int and some element and returns a list that has several repetitions of the same element
replicate' :: (Num i, Ord i) => i -> a -> [a]
replicate' n x

--Note: Num is not a subclass of Ord. 
--That means that what constitutes for a number doesn't really have to adhere to an ordering. 
--So that's why we have to specify both the Num and Ord class constraints when doing addition or subtraction and also comparison.
